# Ransomdoro
A simple software that encrypts files during a certain period of time and then decrypts.

## The idea
The main idea is to have a simple ransomware-like software to make the system unusable 
for a period of time and then decrypt everything.

The idea is to have a pomodoro timer that encrypts the whole system and doesn't allow 
using the system to avoid procrastination or something like.


## 
This software can be potentially harmful, and I don't know if I should put something in here that doesn't make me responsible for everything.
